## This project is just an experiment to reinforce what I learn with Elm

Objective: View a spending graph for a Nubank account

## Installing and start the project

``` bash
npm install && elm install # install dependencies

npm start # start the project
```

#### Is it ok to use this? NuBank won't block me?

As of this tweet, seems that there is no problem in using this! https://twitter.com/nubankbrasil/status/766665014161932288
